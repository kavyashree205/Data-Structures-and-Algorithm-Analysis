CS 5343.501 - Assignment 4
---------------------------

README
------

The source code comprises of one .java file which contains code for both DFS and BFS(for directed/undirected connected/disconnected graphs):
Graph.java

Instructions for compiling and executing:
-----------------------------------------

Eclipse IDE was used to create a Java project and execute.

To run the program from command line:
=====================================
In a command prompt(after navigating to the folder containing the .java file), type the commands 

> javac Graph.java   (compilation; .class files would be generated)
> java Graph		 (execution)



PS : Four screenshots showing 
1. Directed connected graph (DirectConn)
2. Directed unconnected graph (DirectDisconn)
3. Undirected connected graph (UndirectConn)
4. Undirected unconnected graph (UndirectDisconn) have been included.

Numbering of vertices start from 0,1,2,.. and so on. The graph considered has 11 vertices and 16 edges(undirected graph).
