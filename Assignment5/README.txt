---------------------------

README
------

The source code comprises of one .java file:
Prims.java

Instructions for compiling and executing:
-----------------------------------------

Eclipse IDE was used to create a Java project and execute.

> javac Prims.java   (compilation; .class files would be generated)
> java Prims		 (execution)


PS : Also included are two screenshots showing 
1. Directed graph (PrimsDirectedGraphScreenshot)
2. Undirected graph (PrimsUndirectedGraphScreenshot)

Numbering of vertices start from 0,1,2,.. and so on. The graph considered has 11 vertices and 16 edges(undirected graph).
