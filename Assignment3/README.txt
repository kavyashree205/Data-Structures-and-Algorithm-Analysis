-----------------------------------------

Eclipse IDE was used to create a Java project and execute.

To run the program from command line:

In a command prompt(after navigating to the folder containing the .java file), type the commands 

> javac HeapSort.java   (compilation; .class files would be generated)
> java HeapSort		 (execution)



PS : The screenshot of compilation and execution(both from command line and Eclipse IDE) has been attached and contain both steps(before and after heapify,
